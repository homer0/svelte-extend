# svelte-extend - webpack example

This is a basic example of how to use `svelte-extend` with webpack.

The base project is copied from the [official webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/zhanbohui/svelte-webpack-boilerplate).

You can run it with:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm ci
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
